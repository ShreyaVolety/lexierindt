            You know the opinion I entertain of mankind, 
            and how much it is my desire to preserve myself free from 
            particular attachments, and to keep my happiness independent of the caprice of others.
            You should not have taken advantage of my sensibility 
            to steal into my affections without my consent.

            In vain have I struggled. It will not do. 
            My feelings will not be repressed. 
            You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love you.

            Listen, if somebody gave me the choice right now, of to never see you again or to marry you, 
            alright, I would marry you, alright. And maybe that‚Äôs a lot of romantic bullshit, 
            but people have gotten married for a lot less.

            Okay.
Yes.
I'm wrecked. Ended. Done.
I love you and I'm genuinely incapable of telling you how much.
Over the years I've been skeptical of love, I have rejected it, mocked it, denounced it.
And then sometime I clawed at it, desperate for it to fill me up.
I have said I love you to friends and family and boyfriends and I have meant it sometimes, and I have idly repeated it other times

But love isn't repetition.
Apparently, it comes wrapped up in a boi who will talk about adrenaline rushes and fast cars,
Who'll crop both of our faces onto an old power couple as a gift,
Who will send random cat videos to cheer me up,
Who will listen everytime I rant and break down and rant more.

Turns out, love is very very simple.
A little blue üíô and that's all it took for my life to change.

And so now, here I am, 
Telling you
I love you
And it isn't an attempt at anything.
It simply is.
I love you, very much Jochen.
Lexie.
Ankit.
